1
0:00 --> 0:00
Never let anything that happens to you turn you bitter.

2
0:00 --> 0:00
Never let the pain of something out of your hands make you cold.

3
0:00 --> 0:00
Love stays soft, as hard as that is sometimes,

4
0:00 --> 0:00
and try with all your heart to stay tender.

5
0:00 --> 0:00
I know many things hurt, takes us to our knees,

6
0:00 --> 0:00
and threaten our hearts with a stone-cold grudge.

7
0:00 --> 0:00
Let it go. You can't change it, but you can choose not to let it change you.

8
0:00 --> 0:00
Don't let the pain define you. You are bigger than that.

9
0:00 --> 0:00
I hope you know you are never how someone makes you feel.

10
0:00 --> 0:00
Let it hurt, then let it heal.

11
0:00 --> 0:00
But don't linger there.

12
0:00 --> 0:00
Remember who you are, and rise.
